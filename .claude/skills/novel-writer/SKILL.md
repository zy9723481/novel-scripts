## Create New Novel

### Writing Process

```
1. Gather Info → 2. Build Framework → 3. Character Design → 4. Chapter Planning → 5. Start Writing
```

### 1. Gather Basic Information

Ask the user for key details (avoid asking too much at once):

**Required:**
- Genre (sci-fi/fantasy/mystery/romance/wuxia etc.)
- Core concept or inspiration
- Target length (short/medium/long)

**Optional (ask progressively):**
- Protagonist setting
- Desired emotional tone
- Special requirements

### 2. Build Framework

Create a story outline using the **Three-Act Structure**:

- **Act 1 (25%)**: Setup → Inciting Incident → Crossing the Threshold
- **Act 2 (50%)**: Challenges → Midpoint → Crisis → Preparation
- **Act 3 (25%)**: Climax → Resolution → New Normal

**Detailed structure guide**: See [references/story-structure.md](references/story-structure.md)

### 3. Character Design

Create character cards for core characters:

- **Protagonist**: Core desire, core fear, character arc
- **Antagonist**: Motivation, conflict with protagonist
- **Key supporting characters**: Functional role

**Detailed character guide**: See [references/character-development.md](references/character-development.md)

### 4. Chapter Planning

Plan specific chapters based on the outline, clarifying for each:
- POV (perspective)
- Scene location
- Plot points
- Connection to overall story

### 5. Start Writing

Write chapter by chapter according to the plan:
- Maintain consistent perspective
- Vivid scene details
- Dialogue that advances plot
- Appropriate foreshadowing

## Continue Chapter

### Pre-writing Preparation

   - What's the emotional direction?

### Continuation Guidelines

- Maintain consistent character personalities
- Advance main or subplots
- End with a hook

## Character Design

### Design Process

   - Strengths and weaknesses
   - Unique identifiers (speech patterns, habitual gestures)

3. **Design character arc**
   - Starting state
   - Changes experienced

Chapter 1: Dark Descent

"You came." A familiar voice spoke from behind.

He turned to see a dark figure emerging from the stairwell.
